# subitoscraper

## Project for demonstration purposes only
This script returns the links filtered by search and price, the first two variables to be set. Create a history file in APPDATA / LOCAL / TEMP containing the list of all the links already shown, in this way we will always see the links of the objects added in the last days / minutes, based on how often you run it.

## Attention
The script downloads a copy of itself to C: \ programdata \ scraper.py respectively.

Furthermore this file simulates a scheduled task at 9:00 every day, starting the scraper.py.
